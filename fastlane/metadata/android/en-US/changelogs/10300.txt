- New: Per-connection security options â€” toggles to Require encryption (SMB3) and Require signing.
- Fixed: Connections now work with shares that require encryption/signing (Samba smb encrypt = required).
- Improved: Use per-connection SMB client configuration when needed for better compatibility.
- Translations: Added labels for the new options (de, es, fr, nl, pl, zh).
